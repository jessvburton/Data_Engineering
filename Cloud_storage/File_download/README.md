# Google Cloud Storage Object Download Script

This script demonstrates how to download an object from a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket using the `google-cloud-storage` Python library.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account:** You need an active GCP account.
2.  **Google Cloud Storage Bucket:** You need an existing GCS bucket containing the file you want to download.
3.  **Service Account JSON Key:** You need a service account JSON key file with appropriate permissions to read objects in the bucket.
4.  **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
5.  **`google-cloud-storage` Library:** Install the library using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install google-cloud-storage
    ```

## Setup

1.  **Service Account Key:**
    * Download your service account JSON key file.
    * Modify the `service_account` variable in the script to point to the path of your JSON key file. For Example if the file is called `my-service-account.json` the variable should be set to `service_account = "my-service-account.json"`
    * **Important:** Ensure this service account has the `storage.objects.get` permission on the target bucket.
2.  **Configuration:**
    * Open the Python script and modify the following variables:
        * `service_account`: Path to your service account JSON key file (e.g., `"my-service-account.json"`).
        * `bucket_name`: Name of your GCS bucket.
        * `bucket_file_path`: Path to the directory within the bucket (prefix). For example, `"my_directory/"`. If the file is in the root of the bucket, this should be an empty string "".
        * `file_name`: Name of the file to download. This will also be the local filename.
        * `blob_name`: This variable is automatically generated by concatenating `bucket_file_path` and `file_name`.

## Usage

1.  Ensure that the variables `service_account`, `bucket_name`, `bucket_file_path`, and `file_name` are set correctly.
2.  Run the script:

    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

    The script will download the specified object to the current directory and print a confirmation message.

## Example

```python
from google.cloud import storage

service_account = "my-service-account.json" # credentials, ie .json file

bucket_name = "my-bucket"
bucket_file_path = "data/logs/"
file_name = "log.txt"
blob_name = bucket_file_path + file_name

storage_client = storage.Client.from_service_account_json(service_account)
bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
blob = bucket.blob(blob_name)
blob.download_to_filename(file_name)

print(f"{file_name} downloaded from {bucket_name}/{bucket_file_path}")
